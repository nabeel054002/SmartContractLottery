-VERIFIABLE RANDOM FUNCTION

so ig we have to put in link so as to access random numbers, it is based off of a subscription model

Randomness, on the other hand, cannot be reference data. If the result of randomness is stored on-chain, any actor could retrieve the value and predict the outcome. Instead, randomness must be requested from an oracle, which generates a number and a cryptographic proof. 

Then, the oracle returns that result to the contract that requested it. This sequence is known as the Request and Receive cycle.

VRF requests receive funding from subscription accounts. The Subscription Manager lets you create an account and pre-pay for VRF requests, so that funding of all your application requests are managed in a single location.
